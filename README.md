Inventory Management System
This project is an Inventory Management System designed to showcase proficiency in modern web development technologies. The system includes a backend built with NestJS and a frontend developed with Next.js.

Technologies Used: NestJS for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Jest with React Testing Library for testing. The project is deployed with Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend.

Features include product management, order management, and category management.

Installation: Clone the repository and follow these steps. For the backend, navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies with npm install, set up environment variables in a .env file, run migrations with npm run migration:run, and start the server with npm run start:dev. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies with npm install, and start the development server with npm run dev.

Testing: Run tests for both frontend and backend using npm run test.

Deployment: The backend is deployed on Render and the frontend is deployed on Vercel.

Usage: Access the frontend at https://<frontend-deployment-url>. The frontend interacts with the backend API to manage inventory, products, and orders.
